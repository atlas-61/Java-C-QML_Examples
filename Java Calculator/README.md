Final project for Java course in Brno University of Technology. It is a binary operation calculator.
It means you can operate only two values at the same time.
It has a memory which can store result and operations.
When you scroll up/down in the left blank area it shows previous/latest calculations.
If there is a calculations in memory, M symbol turns green.
It has some scientific functions and hex numbers.
Codes are pretty nasty and bad. I will improve myself.
